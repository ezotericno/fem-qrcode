## My process

This is technically my second attempt of this challenge. I ended up scrapping my first attempt and starting completely over, this time I took a step-by-step approach.
The first go around I was working for hours and was not able to produce something close to a solution. I took a couple days break, then decided to start all over from scratch. I started off editing the html file and sorting things to make it more readable in a side-by-side window in Github Codespaces. After the html file setup, I begun creating my scss files and started Live Sass Compiler. I separated my Sass veriables and basic configurations into their own files and used ``` @import ``` to get them into the main. Once everything was setup it was time to style everything was Sass. It took a good amount of time getting things to the right shape and lined up properly, but eventually I had everything pretty good. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Github Codespaces
  - Extensions used:
    - Live Sass compiler
    - Live Server
    - Prettier

### What I learned

Building off of just a screenshot takes a lot of work and research. [This website](https://www.w3docs.com/) was a huge help during the whole process. I wanted to see how far
I could get with just my initial knowledge at first, then I begun looking at the former website for things I did not know how to do. Doing this taught me a lot about the workflow and how setting up your coding envirornment is one of the keys to success.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [W3 Docs](https://www.w3docs.com/) - This website was my main source of tutorials when it came to CSS styling
- [W3 Schools](www.w3schools.com) - I used this as a secondary resource with learning how to use flex and alignment with items

## Acknowledgments

Big shoutout to @coder-coder, I was first introduced to their content via the [freeCodeCamp.org's](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) YouTube videos. While watching some of the html and CSS/Sass videos I got excited and interested in learning web-development.
